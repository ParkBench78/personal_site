On this project, I experimented on color choices & fonts. I especially used combinations of colors that would complement each other but were also bold. I used two different fonts to separate out sections, and Hover to highlight actions. 
One major challenge for me was defining boxes and placing them on a page.
I enjoyed this project for its creativity and challenge. I learned a lot.
